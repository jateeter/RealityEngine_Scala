# RealityEngine_Scala Guidance

Last reviewed: 2026-06-22

See `/Users/johnt/workspace/GitHub/claude.md` for the integrated application map. Update both this file and the root map when Scala RE, Scala PE, actor behavior, or parity responsibilities change.

## Role

This repo contains the Scala/Akka Reality Engine and a standalone Scala Perception Engine. It participates as `scala-1` in multi-engine runs and is a parity target against C++ and LSP.

## Codebase Map

- `src/main/scala/com/realityengine/Main.scala`: RE entrypoint.
- `src/main/scala/com/realityengine/api/`: RE HTTP routes and JSON contracts.
- `src/main/scala/com/realityengine/engine/`: core RE/PE model, simulation, sampling, and perception logic.
- `src/main/scala/com/realityengine/actors/`: machine actor execution.
- `src/main/scala/com/realityengine/services/`: vector store, machine loader, dispatch binding, and CES coverage.
- `src/main/scala/com/realityengine/models/`: machine, vector, perceptual-space, output, and CES domain types.
- `src/main/scala/com/realityengine/generated/`: generated machine bindings.
- `perception-engine/src/`: standalone Scala PE.
- `perception-engine/src/api/`: PE routes and websocket broadcast actor.
- `perception-engine/src/store/`: PE source persistence.
- `perception-engine/src/mqtt/`: MQTT bridge.
- `src/test/`, `perception-engine/tests/`: test coverage.

## Building

**Builds are controlled through `RealityEngine_CI`, not from here.** This repo is
an independent git repository, not a subproject of CI or of any other engine.
Read the contract before building or deploying:

    RealityEngine_CI/docs/BUILD_CONTROL_CONTRACT.md

```bash
cd ../RealityEngine_CI && ./scripts/regression-test.sh --build-only
```

**This repository contains two independent sbt builds, not one build with two
subprojects.** The root `build.sbt` declares no `lazy val` subprojects, no
`aggregate` and no `dependsOn`, so **the root assembly does not produce the
perception engine**. Each needs its own invocation from its own directory:

```bash
sbt clean assembly                          # → target/scala-2.13/reality-engine.jar
(cd perception-engine && sbt clean assembly) # → perception-engine/target/scala-2.13/perception-engine.jar
```

`compile` is not `assembly`. `startUniverse.sh` launches fat jars; building with
`compile` produces classes and leaves the jars untouched, and `start.sh` rebuilds
stale jars on the way up so a local run hides the mistake entirely
(`RealityEngine_CI#173`).

## Key Commands

```bash
sbt test
cd perception-engine && sbt test
cd perception-engine && make e2e-healthkit-spezi
```

## Runtime Contract

- Keep RE/PE routes and payloads aligned with C++ and LSP.
- Be careful with startup smoke tests that mutate active state before byte-equivalence checks.
- Keep machine loading, source counts, and serialized payloads explicit when debugging parity drift.
- Use the same ACP/OpenClaw environment defaults as the rest of the application.

## LSP Support

Use Metals with `sbt`. Import both root and `perception-engine` builds when working across RE and PE. Use markdown, JSON, and Bash support where relevant.

## Editing Rules

- Run `sbt test` for root engine changes.
- Run PE `make` targets for standalone PE changes.
- Do not commit generated runtime state or local data unless explicitly requested.

## MUST: every use of the word "registry" carries a qualifier

**The word "registry" MUST NEVER appear unqualified. Every single use of the
word takes a qualifier naming which registry is meant.**

This is a hard requirement, not a style preference. It applies to every
occurrence in every context, with no exceptions: prose, end-of-task summaries,
commit messages, PR bodies, issue titles and bodies, code comments, docstrings,
variable and function names, log lines, and documentation.

Wrong, in every case — these are all violations:

- "the registry"
- "a versioned registry"
- "the registry file" / "update the registry" / "registry-backed"
- "check the registry first"
- "registry drift"

Right — a qualifier every time:

- "the **instance** registry"
- "a versioned **cesgen** registry"
- "the **arbitration** registry"
- "**machine** registry drift"

If you type the word "registry" and the word immediately before it is not a
qualifier, stop and add one. Re-read every summary and every message for the
bare word before sending it — that is where this rule is actually broken, because
the surrounding context makes the referent feel obvious in the moment. That
feeling is exactly the assumption the rule exists to block.

Qualifiers currently in use. **This list is open, not exhaustive** — a registry
added later gets a qualifier too; nothing is ever promoted to being "the
registry" by virtue of being the one under discussion:

- **instance** registry — `/tmp/re-registry/re-registry.json`, served at
  `:5999/re-registry.json`. Running RE/PE instances with `re_url`/`pe_url`/ports,
  plus `services` and `allocation`. What `RE_REGISTRY_URL` points at.
- **machine** registry — the machines a runtime holds in memory, reported by
  `GET /api/machines`. Distinct from `GET /api/machines/json/list`, the on-disk
  corpus catalog.
- **cesgen** registry — `RealityEngine_Machines/domains/ces-contract-registry.json`.
  Which CES output-stream contract shards exist, what corpus each was recorded
  against, whether each is current.
- **arbitration** registry — `machines/domains/arbitration-registry.json`.
- **domain** registry — `machines/domains/domain-registry.json`.
- **semantic-bus** registry — `machines/domains/semantic-bus-registry.json`.
- **tag** registry — `RealityEngine_CI/docs/TAG_REGISTRY.md`.

## MUST: verify a merge beyond the hosted checks

**A green PR is not a verified PR. Never merge on the hosted checks alone.**

The hosted path does not exercise this system's integration points. A PR can show
every check green and still be unverified, because the checks that ran were a
security scan and — at most — a corpus gate. `localAIStack`, `localOpenClawStack`,
Ollama, Qdrant, MQTT, the OpenClaw ACP gateway and the multi-engine universe are
**not** reachable from the hosted runners, so nothing on that path can tell you
whether the change works where it has to work.

Observed repeatedly: RealityEngine_Machines PRs report exactly one check
(GitGuardian). That is not evidence about the corpus, the registries, the
engines, or any bridge.

Before merging, verify **locally**, and say in the PR which of these you ran and
what they returned:

- The repo's own gates — `validate-corpus.sh`, the contract suite,
  `npm test`, `make test`, `sbt test` — whichever the change touches.
- The integration points the change can reach: a live 3-of-3 universe, the
  local AI stack, the OpenClaw gateway, MQTT — whichever the change can affect.
- The specific behaviour the change claims, with the numbers it produced.

If an integration point cannot be exercised, **say so in the PR** and name it.
An unverified area that is named is a known gap; an unverified area that is
silent reads as tested.

A hosted green tells you the change did not break the hosted path. That is worth
having and is not the question being asked at merge time.
